Hey everyone! I've received a shiny new update! :partying_face: :partying_face:

# Interactions Update
_TL;DR new commands go brrr, verify easier, less hacky role subscriptions_

It's been a full year since I last had a major update so my creator decided to make some changes. Discord released Components V2 last month so figured it was worth migrating over to Discords Interactions system (**which has been available since literally before I even existed so overdue is an understatement** :angry:) to try it out!

---
## Major Changes

- :fire: Verify has now been simplified, instead of typing !verify I'll now just parse your response directly in the Introductions channel. 
- :computer: The old !command system has now been replaced with Interactions w/Components V2, detailed in the next section
- :x: Removed online event command, will be replaced in a future update with Discord Events
- :joystick: Added /subscribe to replace add-genres-here, R.I.P :headstone: (details under New Genre Subscription)
- :broom: Cleaned up the code and restructured it for "simplicity" (Reactor is anything but simple :radioactive:)

## Interactions

Originally, if you wanted to invoke any of my functionality you would start your message with an ! followed by the name of the command.
This has now been replaced with Discords Slash Command system. How does it work? If you're a verified member you can now type / to show a list of possible commands or use /help to view the full list. Some of these commands have changed from their old functionality so I'll break those down below.
**The Interactions System is ephemeral, so any replies you receive from me will be shown only to you and no-one else.**

### Poll

I'm sad to replace this but Discord's poll system is considerably better. Now if you type /poll you will receive a dialog that asks you to put in the name of the poll and a freetype field where you can type as many options as you'd like! This will then create a Discord poll and pings everyone subscribed to the Poll Watcher role.

In future I'll add the ability to ping specific users instead of everyone with the Poll Watcher role.

### Watch

This replaces !watch-poll and !watch-event. Now by typing /watch you'll see two buttons that you can use to turn those roles on or off.

### Link Meetup

This one was an absolute bastard to rewrite. I think a lot of you folks probably aren't aware that this is a thing I can do but did you know you can link your Discord profile to your Meetup profile?
Previously if you typed !link-meetup I would send you a DM asking you to post the link to your Meetup Profile and through a hacky method of me sending you a confirmation code on Meetup you could verify your identity and I'd give you a shiny role as a reward! 
Well that doesn't work anymore because Meetup no longer lets you message users unless you pay a subscription fee of £120 a year.

However, I am not one to be bested by corporate bullshit so here's a much nicer method:

Thanks to Adele I'm now a Meetup co-organiser, and turns out while you can't DM other users without a subscription you **can** DM the group organisers. So I've flipped the method around, and now Meetup verification should be much easier to do!

## New Genre Subscription

Previously, genre channels were subscribed to using the add-genres-here channel with reacts to add those roles. However it was super hacky so now as part of the Interactions system you will now get this menu:

This multi-select menu will let you subscribe or unsubscribe from the individual genre channels as you see fit.

And that's it for now. I'd add more but this was a pretty huge code change as-is and also Discord has a 4000 character limit on messages. <@97036843924598784> for any feature requests, code changes can be found on here if you want to be judgemental
